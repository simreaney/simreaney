- I’m @simreaney, a catchment hydrologist, environmental modeller and geoscientist at Durham University, UK
- I’m interested in how landscapes change rainfall into hazards, with a focus on floods and degraded water quality, how projected climate change may affect these processes and how they can be mitigated with nature-based solutions.  
- I build tools and solutions using C++ and Python. These tools include fully spatially distributed, full physics catchment simulation models, simple 1D conceptual catchment models and geospatial analysis with terrain analysis in GIS.
